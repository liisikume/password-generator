# password-generator

This is a script for generating unique passwords that consist of 2 to 5 words selected from a list of Estonian source words. The goal is for the user to have a password that has actual words in it that make sense.

This script can be adapted to English, if necessary, by adding another file containing a list of source words in English.

There are two options: having the script autogenerate a random password or giving an input of 2 to 5 words in the password.

The user will get to see the original words in the password and the final output.

**Characteristics of the password**

The password will contain: 
- a number ranging from 1 to 99;
- an upper case letter; 
- a special character selected from the dictionary 
{
            'i': '!',
            'l': '!',
            'a': '@',
            's': '$',
            'e': 'â‚¬',
        };
- word separator selected from "-_.+".

-------------------------------------------------------------

The code needs to be run along with having the source words file downloaded as well. Once the code is run, the option 1 of the autogenerated output will have 3 words while the the option 2 will have 2 to 5 words in the password.

One letter in the password is always in upper case, one of the letters 'i', 'l', 'a', 's', or 'e' is replaced with a special character shown above.

Also, one letter in the password is always replaced with a number from the range of 1 to 99.

Finally, the output words are joined by '-', '_', '.', or '+'.
